<h2> Purpose </h2>
<p>A prototype of deep convolutional neural network-based approach to finding the length of a page in "word-equivalents". 
  The plots in the document have corresponding word-equivalents based on their aspect ratios. The idea here is to test 
the feasibility of a unified CNN model that automatically detects words and figures, and assigns the likely length to 
  the document.
</p>
<h2> How to use </h2>
<p> Download the Jupyter notebook <code>lengthcheck.ipynb</code> in <code>./notebooks/</code>. Load it via Google Colab to run. It should load this repository during the run. The weights for the pretrained CNN model are in the <code>./model/</code></p>
